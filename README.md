My project for Assignment 1 is a prototype for a space shooter. It has a particle effect shader on it that uses a noise texture to change colors over time. Audio is implemented by using it to scale the sizes of the enemies. When the sizes of the enemies reach a certain threshold, they will shoot out projectiles that will damage the player's health. PLEASE PLAY in 1600x1000.

For the second part of this assignment, I thought of a way to implement a shader that simulates raindrops on glass surfaces.
